    Professor Kerry Cronin gave her famous dating talk called “Bring Back the Date” on February 10 at an event sponsored by the St. Thomas More Society. The next night, she gave a follow-up talk
    called “Making the Move: Navigating Dating Transitions,” which was sponsored by the Church in the 21st Century. Cronin criticized the hookup culture at BC, challenged the students to go on a
    date, and spoke about the values that are important in decision-making in relationships.

    As much as I wish I could say I am constantly on top of my work I have to do, the reality is that I procrastinate more than I should. I would rather look at pictures of cute puppies on the
    internet than write an analytic paper on the economic policy of South Africa. I invest a lot of time into Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Buzzfeed, but nothing compares to how much of my life I
    waste on Pinterest. Something about organizing the pictures and links however I want really captivates me. There are hours of my life that I will never get back from scouring the endless pages of
    fashion, food recipes, crafts, and photography. Although I enjoy a lot of the content on Pinterest, there are some posts that really bother me. One post that bothers me the most is a quote that
    reads: “It doesn’t matter how you’re doing on your finals as long as your future husband is acing his.” I was stunned by not only the message, but also by how many girls were eagerly re-posting
    it. It’s sad to think that so many girls agree with this degrading message and think it is funny.
